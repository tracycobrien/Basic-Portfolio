    <body>
        The first thing you should know about me is I'm hilarious so if you don't like funny people it's best to shut
        the browser now.
        The second is I love animals. If you are not an animal person I'm sorry we can't be friends. Third, I'm an
        attorney and yes I have heard all the jokes!
        If you are still reading at this point welcome to my squad, you have past the first three barriers of entry.
        The
        next test is fairly easy to pass first you have to be able to talk about books, then good food,
        horses will elevate you to bonus status, but to be a VIP you really have to love cats. Truly the most important
        element in my life is family and faith.
        If you have read this far you know all the important things about me.
